## OVERVIEW

- Allows single controller to manage multiple devices efficiently  
- Provides Interoperability between multiple Modbus RTU‚Äôs  
- Ease of integration due to widely adopted by many manufacturer  
- Efficient & Reliable communication: deterministic response, error checking  
- Suitable for Industry environment: with RS485 physical layer communication up to several hundreds of meter with better noise immunity  
- Scalability for Multi-device communication:  
  - Device addressing  
  - Polling mechanism

## MAX484 TTL TO RS485 CONVERTER

- Input Voltage: 5V DC  
- Output Voltage: RS485 differential signal  
- Communication: Half-duplex RS485  
- Distance: Up to several hundred meters  

---

## CONNECTION DETAILS

- MODBUS MASTER  
- MODBUS SLAVE  

---

## HIGH-LEVEL IMPLEMENTATION

**Examples of system architecture:**

- STM32 + RTC + MAX485 + I2C OLED + Switch  
- Master and multiple slaves (ID 0x01, 0x02)  
- Switch status polling:  
  - Slave-1: 200 ms  
  - Slave-2: 600 ms  
- Data displayed on OLED  
- Timestamp synchronization  

---

## MODBUS MASTER FIRMWARE

- Read RTC time from serial on time update command  
- Broadcast RTC time on Modbus switch pressed  
- Poll Switch status every 200ms from Slave-1  
- Poll Switch status every 600ms from Slave-2  
- Display time on OLED  
- Display Slave-1 event time stamp  
- Display Slave-2 event time stamp  

---

## MODBUS SLAVE FIRMWARE

- 8 Modbus register to receive the time from the master  
- 1 discrete input for switch status  
- Whenever Switch pressed, capture the status in discrete input  
- Display time on OLED  
- Display last poll received time stamp  
- Switch event time stamp  

---

## TIMMING & EVENT ANALYSIS

- Switch pressed (Slave1)  
- Switch pressed (Slave2)  
- Event updated to master from Slave1  
- Event updated to master from Slave2  

Visual data shows event update intervals (in milliseconds):  
200 ‚Üí 2400 ‚Üí 2200 ‚Üí ...

## SUMMARY

### ‚úÖ Advantages

- Low cost, better noise immunity  
- Scalable: connect up to 32 Slave devices  
- Best suited for monitoring devices in industrial automation  

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Avoid using for real-time controlling  
- Continuous polling by master poses risk of timing mismatch
